Anomaly Detection based on Eccentricity Analysis
	- TEDA framework
		- theory for detecting outliers in traditional 
	- anomaly detection using threshold
	- n-sigma principle
	- Chebyshev inequality
	- 3 sigma: "nearly all" values are taken to lie within three standard 
	deviations of the mean i.e. it is empirically useful to treat 99.7% 
	probability as "near certainty".		
	- sigma gap
	- epsilon vicinity
	- eccentric points
	- Neighbourhood: is a set of points containing that point where one can move
	some amount away from that point without leaving the set.

plotdata not working

plotdata might be a typo

plotdata function missing

got plotdata

lun 17 lug 2017, 16.26.53, CEST

run showdriftdata

not color coded

use following code:
olgpcm(X,rand(4,2),.005,4,1,.8)

centroids follow drifting data
two different data types
one light blue; another dark blue
don't know what light blue and dark blue represent
	- light blue points could be past values
	- dark blue the current values

centroids follow appopriately upto a certain point

then around iteration 2000 one centroid moves away
----------------------------------------
Info given:

	rho(variable): - measure of adequacy of the current clustering to the most 
					recent data.
					- "outlier density" (in physics often densities are 
					indicated with letter rho
					- its values over time are collected in an array rhovals
					that is plotted at the end of training
					- its value is computed as a time-weighted average over 
					recent data of another, instantaneous quantity called
					Omega
		- Omega: Outlierness	
----------------------------------------
showdriftdata.m

at a certain point we can see some outlier points which are far
from the rest of the data points

olgpcm: OnLine Graded Possibilistic C Means
	Output:
		- rhovals
		- summembership
		- U
		- Youtn
		- Y
		- Normvals
		- bend
	
	Input: 
		- X
		- Y
		- bi0
		- K
		- eta0
		- alphamin

olgpcm(X,rand(4,2),.005,4,1,.8)
	- X is given
		- to get X we need to run showdriftdata first before running above 
			command
	- Y is given as a random matrix of (4,2) dimension of values b/w 0 and 1
	- bi0: 0.005
	- K: 4
	- eta0: 1
	- alphamin: 0.8

----------------------------------------
Figures:
	- (1) rho is plotted at the end from the array rhovals 
	- (2) checking parameters at the beginning
	- (3) end of iteration- at the end of 7000 iterations, the state of data
	points and centroids
	- (4) state of data points during initial period in show drift
	- (5) outlier data at some point in show drift
	- (6) olgpcm with centroids and past and present values in initial period
	- (7) outlier in olgpcm around iteration 2000-2050
	- (8) outlier in olgpcm at iter 2050-2100

Z - scaling factor

what is 'a'

b: more or less sensitive to distance
	- if b is more then membership is more sensitive to distance
	- if b is less then membership is less sensitive to distance
----------------------------------------

alpha which prevents the membership from becoming zero.

if alpha is 0 = possiblistic case
alpha is 1 = probablistic case; they behave like probablistic
alpha in between = partially probabilstic

implement equations from the paper for comparison

Zsolt changes in olgpcm

added if(sum(U)>0.5):
Y=Y+((eta*(repmat(X(j,:),size(Y,1),1)-Y).*repmat(U,size(X,2),1)')./sum(U));
end

then changed 0.5 to 1/K on professor's suggestion

what it does is if the membership is too low it just ignores those data points.

lookin for data set of bristol city rainfall in plamen angelov paper

https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets	# possibly this
----------------------------------------


sab 22 lug 2017, 17.57.43, CEST

- got the data from http://www.martynhicks.uk/weather/data.php?page=m01y2014
- put it in excel
- got the eucledian distance between each point by just subtracting each data
from the one preceding it and taking its modulus

- summed up eucledian proximity

- trying to understand what accumulated proximity means
	- is it the distance to each point in the dataset from every data point
	OR is it just equal to the eucledian proximity

On last trial created formulas out of 2nd section of angelov's paper
- only for one dimension
- also done for two dimension

Normalized eccentricity calculated.
sigma_square calculated (variance) is different from the regular variance.
sigma gap principle implemented and two new figures obtained.

anomaly detection done by calculating the zeta of the highest zeta and the next
highest one and checked if its higher than 1/k where k is the number of data 
samples(not the k in clustering); and 1 is 1-sigma

introduced the artificial zeta for the 14th day and checked the above mentioned
code but it doesn't detect the new anomaly.

maybe it's detected by epsilon vicinity. 

epsilon vicinity will have two sets of data points.
	- one which satisfy the above condition of > 1/k
	- and one of normal data points

	- then their average will be subtracted and checked if its higher than 1/k

changes made to anomaly detection
	- index of original array before sorting introduced
	- now it detects the artificial rainfall for the 14th day
	- i changed to j in for loop
	- eccentr changed to sorted in if condition

- Typicality is the complement of eccentrincity

- vid file saved, some more changes needed to slow it down
