# Unsupervised Learning in Evolving Environments

This is the code for my final semester project at University of Genoa. It was done under
the supervision of Professor Stefano Rovetta.

We were given a streaming dataset of 2D position of vehicles at a traffic junction in
Genoa, Italy. Our goal was to detect any anomaly in the dataset. You can find more details
to our approach at this
